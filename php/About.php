						Live Workout Events was created by Group F, a collection of some
						of the smartest minds in the world.  Due to the Coronavirus Outbreak,
						they made it their mission to create workouts that can be performed
						at home. There are five members in Group F, and each of them have a
						unique and captivating story to tell.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mason is currently going to Cal State University Fullerton,
						and is expected to graduate in 2020. He is the primary UI
						interpreter for the Live Workout Events website, and has
						extensive knowledge and experience surrounding audio
						production, video production, and image manipulation. He
						considers himself a Jack-Of-All-Trades. For this website,
						he is responsible for managing the repository and verifying
						that everything is up to standards. If anything, the other
						group members view him as a highly flexible engineer; there
						is not a bit of the website he has not been a part of.
					</p>
					<p>
						Brian is currently going to Cal State University Fullerton.
						He is the website's host, and has implemented several key
						bits of software including user accounts, which requires a
						database. He has also managed all website updates and a
						large amount of PHP related code. He has proven to be the
						de-facto team leader due to his inspiring leadership
						abilities. he also constantly recognizes the
						accomplishments of his fellow groupmates.
					</p>
					<p>
						David is currently going to Cal State University Fullerton,
						and has made a substantial effort in order to implement a
						database and have it interface with the website. While this
						is no easy task, he continues to put in his best effort to
						complete his objective. He constantly works alongside Brain
						in order to more efficiently complete the tasks at hand.
						Many of the group members view him as the 'admiral' of the
						project, due to his constant and unwavering determination
						and power of will.
					</p>
					<p>
						Farzan is currently going to Cal State University Fullerton.
						He has mainly been responsible for cleaning up html and php
						code. While many would be unwilling to put in the effort to
						do so, Farzan has made it his goal to keep the website in
						working order, no matter what. As such, his group members
						see him as a purifier, which cleans up unwanted mistakes and
						errors. He has worked with Mason in order to keep the website
						pure and untouched by bad css, html, and php code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Suhrab is currently going to Cal State University Fullerton.
						He has made it his objective to update webpages using
						hand-crafted code. His pages might not always be the final
						versions used, but they provide a basis for expansion.
