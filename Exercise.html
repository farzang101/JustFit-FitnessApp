					Name: Plank
				</br>
				<br>
					Description: Rest your forearms on the floor, with your elbows directly underneath your shoulders and hands facing forward so that your arms are parallel. Extend your legs out behind you and rest your toes on the floor. Your body should form one straight line from your shoulders to your heels. Squeeze your entire core, your glutes, and your quads, and tuck your butt under a little to keep your lower back straight. Make sure you are not dropping your hips or hiking your butt up high toward the ceiling. Position your head so that your neck is in a neutral position and your gaze is on your hands. Hold this position.

					Name: High Boat to Low Boat

					Description: Sit up straight with your legs bent, feet flat on the floor. Keeping your legs together, slowly lift them off the floor until they form a 45-degree angle to your torso. Engage your entire core, keep your back flat, and balance on your tailbone. You can keep your knees bent (as pictured) or straighten them out for more of a challenge. Reach your arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the floor. If you feel that you need some extra support, place your hands on the floor, underneath your hips. This is High Boat. Hold here for three deep breaths. Then, lower your legs, straightening them out, while also lowering your upper body. Both your shoulder blades and legs should hover a few inches off the floor. If that is too challenging, keep them slightly higher off the floor and work toward bringing them lower and lower. This is Low Boat. Hold for one breath, and then lift your legs and torso back to High Boat.

In this exercise, you sit with legs extended and torso off the ground, your body forming a V shape. If you are a beginner you can modify it to use a bit of assistance from your hands, or do it with bent legs. Intermediate exercisers can add this exercise to abdominal and core workouts.

					Name: Forearm Plank Reach Out
				</br>
				<br>
					Description: Start in a forearm plank position, with your elbows directly under your shoulders, hands facing forward so your forearms are parallel, core engaged, hips level, and legs extended straight behind you. From this position, reach your right hand forward and tap the floor in front of you. Return your right hand to your starting position, and then reach forward with your left hand to tap the floor in front of you.

The wider your feet, the easier the move should be.

					Name: Superman With Arm Extension
				</br>
				<br>
					Description: Lie facedown on a mat with your arms at shoulder height and elbows bent to 90 degrees, so you're making a goalpost shape with your arms. This is your starting position. Engage your shoulders, glutes, and hamstrings to lift your chest, arms and feet off the floor to come into a superman. Be mindful that you do not crunch your low back—this is a strength move, it's not about flexibility or how high you can arch your back. Holding in this raised position, extend your arms overhead so both arms are straight and your biceps are inline with your ears. Return your arms to the goalpost position, then lower everything back down to the floor to complete the rep.
